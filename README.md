# cpp_development
I published this project as example of C++ development.
The main idea of the project is development of class, which will describe a matrix based on linked lists, and a class, which will describe an algebraic vector based on linked lists. Also I implemented a functional for main operations of matrix and vector algebras. And for ease of use i implemented a user-friendly menu. More information you can find in file called "information" (RUS), where I published full report about the program.
